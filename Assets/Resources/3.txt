Location: Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG)

It was at the Johannesburg Art Gallery that this Clerk put his grand scheme into action. As the senior Clerk he was organising the annual birthday of ConHill. The Gallery was only used for such events and was primarily a means for propaganda. 

It was on the 50th Birthday of ConHill that the stolen documents were hung and exhibited. It was only after the Judges arrived for the festivities that the Twist Street Riot was quelled. By ‘riot’ the CPR meant the slaughter of all those who worked at the gallery and all those who were attending the event, the Judges excluded. 

Although the exhibition was closed the day it opened. The clerk, who was not yet suspected, had done enough.
