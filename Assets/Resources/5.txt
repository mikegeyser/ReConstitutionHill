Date: February 2056

Location: ConHill, CBD Seat of Power

Two years to the day from the Twist Street Massacre the Clerk and two thousand activists stormed ConHill. Met by armed and savage CPR forces, the battle was horrific. The Old Fort held for two days. When the walls were eventually scaled, all found inside were slaughtered. The killing continued until the invaders reached the doors of the Court. They called for a surrender of the Judges. Nothing happened. No response. They gave a two-day ultimatum and waited. 

At the end of the second day the doors opened and Judges surrendered. The Clerk, not hesitating, made swift work of them. The cheer that rose was silenced as the ancient De Beer AI spoke: “That will be all. You may leave now. The Judges are dead. You have released me. You have completed everything according to The Plan.” 

The Clerk felt a tingling through his body. His implants were burning. Despite himself he turned to face his allies. Without any thought he murdered them. 

The Clerk patrols the city and keeps it safe. The ConCourt is disbanded, his humanity is gone. But the walls have been torn down and the city is unified again…


To this day the Clerk patrols the city and keeps it safe. The Judges are gone. The walls have been torn down.
