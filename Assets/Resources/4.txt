Location: Doornfontein Station, New IFP Headquarters 

News of what transpired at the Gallery swiftly made itâ€™s way through the CBD. Political Parties hiding in the slums gained ground and became braver. Their assaults, rallies, and sabotage attacks spread. It was not a happy time for the ConCourt. But they were not afraid. 

The ConCourt suspected the Clerk and ordered the CPR to follow him in an attempt to catch those he was working with. After a month he was discovered at the Doornfontein Train Station with an IFP cell. Cornered and outnumbered, the Clerk rallied the activists and fought. He should have died. There was no way to fight or kill the CPR. But he did. And he succeeded. 

For years the clerk had been illegally installing Cybernetic Implants. He now possessed momentous speed, strength, intelligence and ferocity. It is rumoured that some of the CPR fled instead of facing the rage that stood before them. The Clerk became a hero throughout the city. The Court was afraid.
