Location: CBD Archives, Restored Rissik Street Post Office

Countless times after the Charter signing, the IFP and angry civilians would try to invade the Archives. Held in lockdown in the Rissik Street Post Office, these archives were said to contain the history of the Cybernetic Implants, the major mining operations and the sealing of the CBD. All rulings of the ConCourt were buried deep in the vaults. All attempts to gain access was thwarted by the CRP (Cybernetic Regulation Police). The only people seen entering or leaving the Rissik Street Fortress were the ConCourt judges and their high level clerks.
	
This was how the theft from the fort occurred. A senior clerk to the Chief Justice was skimming a few files from the deepest archives every time he visited. He is also the only traitor of the ConCourt ever. These thefts, as was his intention, caused havoc.
