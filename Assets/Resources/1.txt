Location: Abandoned Train Station Under the Nelson Mandela Bridge

Joburg, City of Gold, is in ruin. Over the years the city has been torn apart. 

In an attempt to save those they could from the spreading madness, decay and greed, the Constitution Court (ConCourt) sealed the CBD off. With the seat of power at Constitution Hill (ConHill) the ConCourt ruled ruthlessly. The 11 Judges changed the laws at will, recruited mercenaries to enforce their will and subdue all resistance. The public grew disgruntled; there was no wealth and no means to prosper. Life was hard.

The glory days forgotten, resistance rose and lived in pockets throughout the city. A unified front only became active when an ancient political party, the IFP, declared war on ConHill. In an abandoned Train Station they signed their Charter, announced they had spies throughout the city and vowed to release all people from the secrecy and oppression. “We Will Know The Truth and be Reconciled”.
